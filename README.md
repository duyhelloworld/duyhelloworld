- In this overview, i will show all my desktop which I'm using to code

## OS (Operating System)
1. Ubuntu
-   [What is Ubuntu?](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=what+is+ubuntu)
![](what-is-ubuntu.jpg)
-  Why is Ubuntu?

-> Ubuntu is perfect to learning and running server

2. Window 10
- No ask what it is, just ask why it not become my main OS
> 1. So heavy and much excessive function
![](context-menu.png)
> 2. Hard to fix system error
![](blue-screen.png)
- Why it not notify the error for user like Linux?
> Although I decried Windows a lot, the fact that Window is do some work better than Linux
> - Popular and friendly for beginner
> - Security
> - Microsoft become supporting for devs and open-source environment
### Conclustion
#### I think "Window is good for working and longtime coding, and Linux is accordant for learning and level bigger"

## Software
1. Chrome & Firefox
- Every web browser just need to do its main role. 
>   - I surf the Net, I need good UX, security and multi-task experience better <br>--> Chrome
>   - I code some web. I need DevTools support better, open-source and more "anti-advertistment" <br> --> Firefox
2. Visual Code
- It's free, multi-language support and good AI suggesting
> My setup VS code <br>
> **Extension**
> - For language : C/C++ pack, Java (by VScode suggest + [Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sohibe.java-generate-setters-getters)), [auto-rename tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag), [Live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
